                Sherry is a fortified wine, crafted in the area around Jerez de la Frontera -- often seen shortened to Jerez -- in the southern autonomous region of Spain known as Andalusia. Contrary to popular belief, sherry is more than a sweet desert wine meant for post-dinner consumption. Much like its country of origin, sherry is multi-faceted, coming in seven varieties ranging from crisp, dry fino to dark, sweet Pedro Ximenez.

                What makes sherry special? First...
                
                Sherries are aged in a unique system called the solera, where barrels of fortified wines sit for years at ambient temperatures in a stacked formation. The . Portions of the wine are periodically removed from the oldest barrels for bottling, with new stocks added to keep the solera going.

                Sherry is a fortified wine, crafted in the area around Jerez de la Frontera -- often seen shortened to Jerez -- in the southern autonomous region of Spain known as Andalusia. Contrary to popular belief, sherry is more than a sweet desert wine meant for post-dinner consumption. Much like its country of origin, sherry is multi-faceted, coming in seven varieties ranging from crisp, dry fino to dark, sweet Pedro Ximenez.

                <h3>Creating a bottle of sherry</h3>
                So how does one go about making a bottle of sherry? Sherry wine is reputed to be over 3,000 years old. Indeed, the first mention of sherry wine is made by a Greek geographer Strabo in the 1st century B.C. From the region of Jerez, as it is known today, traders shipped sherry throughout the Mediterranean basin, particularly Rome.

                For over 3,000 years different historical circumstances have moulded the identity of these wines. But what are the characteristics of sherry wines as we know them today?

                <strong>Fortification</strong>
                Shipping wine oversease in wine casks was problematic, as the casks were not air-tight, resulting in oxidized wine, i.e. vinegar. Winemakers soon learned to add spirits to their wine to reduce spoilage on long shipments. 
                
                By adding the spirits in a different times in the fermentation process, winemakers could control the sugar content in their products. Adding the spirits pre-fermentation, as in Pedro Ximenez sherry for example, would result in a sweeter wine as the sugar in the spirit would be converted during the fermentation process. For the majority of sherry, un-aged brandy is added post-fermentation, resulting in a dryer vintage.

                <strong>The Grapes: Palomino, Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel de Alejandria </strong>
                Sherry is made from the Palomino, Pedro Ximenez, and Moscatel de Alejandria (Muscat of Alexandria) grape varieties. Most commonly, the Palomino grape is used, but Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel grapes are used in the creation of their respective sweet, eponymous sherry varieties.

                Sherry  is primarily made from the Palomino grape, account for 95% of all sherry production. These relatively unknown grapes thrive in the humid climate and unique white, chalky soils of the region known as <em>albariza</em>. While they are not necessarily well-suited to making traditional wine, the Palomino is perfect for sherry which is fortified with spirits post-fermentation.

                On the other hand, Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel de Alejandria (Muscat of Alexandria) grapes only produce a small portion of overall sherry production, and undergo a special process called <em>pasificaci√≥n</em> before fermentation. In this process, after the grapes are harvested they are laid out on grass matts to dry in the sun, effectively turning the grapes into raisins. Additionally, unlike its dryer, Palomino-derived cousins, brandy is added to Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel de Alejandria sherry varieties during fermentation in order to produce a sweeter sherry.

                Sherry is a fortified wine, crafted in the area around Jerez de la Frontera -- often seen shortened to Jerez -- in the southern autonomous region of Spain known as Andalusia. Contrary to popular belief, sherry is more than a sweet desert wine meant for post-dinner consumption. Much like its country of origin, sherry is multi-faceted, coming in seven varieties ranging from crisp, dry fino to dark, sweet Pedro Ximenez.

                <strong>Foritification</strong>
                What does it mean to call sherry a 'fortified wine'? Fortified wines came about in a time before refrigeration. Shipping wine oversease in wine casks was problematic, as the casks were not air-tight, often resulting in oxidized wine -- read vinegar. Winemakers soon learned to add spirits to their wine to reduce spoilage on long shipments. By adding the spirits in a different times in the fermentation process, winemakers could control the sugar content in their products. Adding the spirits pre-fermentation, as in port wines for example, would result in a sweeter wine as the sugar in the spirit would be converted during the fermentation process. 
                
                Regarding sherry, brandy is always added post-fermentation resulting in a dryer vinteage.

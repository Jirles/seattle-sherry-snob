                Sherry, in the immortal words of the great playwright and novelist, W. Somerset Maugham, is truly the civilized drink. For 11 years, we brothers Crane quaffed sherry each week. Now, we would like to invite you to join us in enjoying the same spirit that has bolstered our spirits through countless (but perhaps somewhere around 264) trials and tribulations.

                The <em>Seattle Sherry Snob</em> - and we wear that title with pride - aims to your sherry sherpa, guiding you through the inhostpitable wilderness of ignorance to the verdant pastures of experience. We have amassed a collection of available vintages for your perusal and collated comments from your fellow sherry enthusiasists. If you are a true sherry novice, please see our 'Sherry 101' page to learn more about this divine digestif.

                In closing, my brother, Niles, and I have been fortified by this fortified wine for over a decade. We hope that you too may find a modicum of comfort in her warm embrace. Welcome, and please drink responsibly.
